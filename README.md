# HipChat Incident Webhook

This is a Python/Django web app that listens for incident numbers mentioned in HipChat and returns a response to the room with useful information about that incident.

### ToDo's

- Get webapp to a beta-version deployed on Heroku to be installed on individual HipChat rooms.
- Add configuration options to select what is returned to the room.
    + Alternatively, fine-tune defaults to be very useful and not annoying.
- Comment code effectively...
